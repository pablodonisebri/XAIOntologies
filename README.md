# Combining ontologies and machine learning models for Explainable AI

This is the repository for the master thesis entitled: Combining ontologies and machine learning models for Explainable AI.

Here you will find all the resources implemented throughout the work. 

  * *DL-Learner Trials/* ->  You will find the initial steps with DL-Learner taken for the development of the work.
                         There is a folder for each trial and in it there are all the files needed to run the experiment
                         and in the file with extension .txt there is an explanation of the trial.
                        
  * *Experiment1_Titanic/* -> You will find in the .py file the preprocessing of the data that produces clean.csv, the mappings .yaml and .rml
                          to generate Titanic.nt (N-Triples file) and Titanic.ipynb that contains all the experimentation performed.
   
  * *Experiment2_Carcinogenesis/* -> You will find the data in the files with .n,.f and .owl files and in Carcinogenesis.ipynb the experimentation
                                    performed.
